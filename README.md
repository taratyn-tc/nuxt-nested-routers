# Nuxt 3 Nested Dynamic Router examples.

Gives an example of how to do a nested dynamic router in Nuxt 3 app.
The [official docs on nested routers](https://nuxt.com/docs/guide/directory-structure/server#nested-router) are sparse.
This repo is a minimal example of how to do it.

See the `testing.http` file for some HTTP requests to test this out.

```shell
npm ci
npm run dev
```
